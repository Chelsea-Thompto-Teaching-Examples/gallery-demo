# Gallery Demo

## Overview
A basic set image gallery examples using HTML and CSS. The examples use flexbox and grid to display multiple images in a response grid. The demo is both this repository and a live site. Further details about the code can be found on the live site which can be viewed here:

## HTML

The galleries are accomplished using a container "div" tag which contains an additional "div" for each image, which uses the "img" tag, in the grid. The behavior of the nested divs and images are dictated by the style rules found in the style.css document. 

## CSS

In addition to the rules governing the behavior of the galleries overall, which can be found in the rules starting with a period that match the classes defined in the page's HTML, there are also rules defining the hover interactions found on each page. These rules use the same classes
